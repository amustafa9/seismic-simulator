    "Simulating the 1D wave equation is a classic problem in computational physics and is the foundation for the seismic simulations you are building in your project.\n",

    "The most common method for this is the Finite Difference Method (FDM). Here is a walkthrough of how the algorithm works, from the physics to the code.\n",

    "1. The Physics (The Equation)\n",
    "The 1D acoustic wave equation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial t^2} = c^2 \\frac{\\partial^2 u}{\\partial x^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "$u(x,t)$ is the displacement (amplitude) of the wave at position $x$ and time $t$.\n",
    "$c$ is the speed of the wave in the medium.\n",
    "The left side represents acceleration (change in velocity over time).\n",
    "The right side represents the curvature of the wave shape (change in slope over space).\n",
    "2. The Math (Discretization)\n",
    "Computers cannot solve continuous derivatives directly, so we approximate them using a grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "Space ($x$): Divided into discrete points separated by distance $\\Delta x$.\n",
    "Time ($t$): Divided into discrete steps separated by time $\\Delta t$.\n",
    "We use the Central Difference approximation for the derivatives. If $u_i^n$ is the amplitude at grid point $i$ and time step $n$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\frac{u_i^{n+1} - 2u_i^n + u_i^{n-1}}{\\Delta t^2} \\approx c^2 \\frac{u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n}{\\Delta x^2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging this to solve for the future state ($u_i^{n+1}$), we get the update formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ u_i^{n+1} = 2u_i^n - u_i^{n-1} + \\left( \\frac{c \\Delta t}{\\Delta x} \\right)^2 (u_{i+1}^n - 2u_i^n + u_{i-1}^n) $$"
